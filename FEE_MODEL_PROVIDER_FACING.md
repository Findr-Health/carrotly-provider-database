## Our Promise: You Keep More

We believe healthcare providers deserve fair, transparent pricing. That's why we've designed the lowest fees in the industry with a cap that rewards you as you grow.

---

## How Our Fees Work

### The Formula
```
10% of your service price + $1.50 per booking
Never more than $35 total
```

That's it. No monthly subscriptions. No per-lead charges. No hidden costs.

## Why Our Fees Are Different

### ✅ No Monthly Fees
Other platforms charge $139-$699/month just to be listed. We charge $0.

### ✅ No Per-Lead Fees  
Some platforms charge $35-$110 every time someone *inquires* about your services—even if they never book. We only charge when you actually get paid.

### ✅ Capped at $35
Whether your service is $400 or $4,000, our fee never exceeds $35. The more you earn, the more you keep.

### ✅ Every Booking Counts
Unlike platforms that only charge for "new patients," we treat every booking the same—and our rates are still lower.
