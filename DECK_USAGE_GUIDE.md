## 🎯 PRESENTATION TIPS

### Timing (20-minute pitch)
- **Slides 1-3** (5 min): Problem/Opportunity
- **Slides 4-5** (3 min): Who we are/How we're different
- **Slide 6** (3 min): The experience (this is the hero slide)
- **Slide 7** (4 min): Business model/ROI
- **Slides 8-9** (3 min): Pilot structure/Competitive positioning
- **Slide 10** (2 min): The ask

### Key Talking Points
1. **Lead with credibility** (Slide 4) - "We're not outsiders, we're healthcare insiders"
2. **Emphasize psychology** (Slide 2, 5) - "It's not the message, it's the messenger"
3. **Show real user journey** (Slide 6) - Make Sarah feel real
4. **De-risk the ask** (Slide 8, 10) - "$250K maximum risk for $177M proof"
5. **Create urgency** (Slide 9) - "12-18 month lead if you move now"

### Handling Questions

**"How do you know 62% action rate?"**
→ "Based on our wellness platform data where users already trust us"

**"Why California for pilot?"**
→ "MedImpact is headquartered in San Diego, strong member density in Southern CA"

**"What if we want more member-specific data?"**
→ "We can layer that in Phase 2, but simplicity accelerates the pilot"

**"What about HIPAA?"**
→ "Zero PHI sharing required. Just pharmacy list, mail-order URL, copay structure"
