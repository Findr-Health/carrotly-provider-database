## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Findr Health. These Terms of Service ("Terms", "Agreement") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "Patient", "you", or "your") and Findr Health, LLC, a Montana limited liability company ("Findr Health", "Company", "we", "us", or "our") governing your access to and use of the Findr Health website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the "Platform").

**BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT, BOOKING AN APPOINTMENT, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE PLATFORM.**

## SECTION 1: PLATFORM DESCRIPTION AND RELATIONSHIP

### 1.1 What Findr Health Is

Findr Health is a technology platform and online marketplace that connects users with independent healthcare and wellness providers ("Providers"). The Platform allows you to: (a) search for Providers by location, specialty, and services; (b) view Provider profiles, services, and pricing; (c) book appointments with Providers; and (d) pay for services through our secure payment system.

### 1.2 What Findr Health Is NOT

**FINDR HEALTH IS NOT A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, MEDICAL PRACTICE, CLINIC, OR HEALTHCARE FACILITY.** We do not:

- Provide, recommend, or endorse any healthcare, medical, wellness, or therapeutic services
- Employ, supervise, direct, or control Providers listed on the Platform
- Provide medical advice, diagnoses, treatment recommendations, or second opinions
- Guarantee the quality, safety, legality, or outcomes of any services provided by Providers
- Independently verify Provider credentials, licenses, insurance, or qualifications. While Providers attest to their credentials during onboarding, users are responsible for independently verifying this information through official sources
- Make any representations regarding Provider competency, experience, or suitability for your needs

### 1.3 Independent Provider Relationship

**ALL PROVIDERS ON THE PLATFORM ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, NOT EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES OF FINDR HEALTH.** Each Provider operates their own independent practice and is solely responsible for: (a) the services they provide; (b) their professional conduct; (c) maintaining required licenses and insurance; (d) complying with all applicable laws and professional standards; and (e) all clinical decisions and patient care.

### 1.4 Your Relationship with Providers

When you book an appointment through the Platform, you are entering into a direct relationship with the Provider, not with Findr Health. Any healthcare services, treatments, advice, or care you receive are provided solely by the Provider. Findr Health is not a party to the provider-patient relationship and has no responsibility for the services you receive.

## SECTION 2: ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT REGISTRATION

You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to create an account and use the Platform. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old.

### 2.1.1 Booking for Minors

Adult users may book appointments on behalf of minor dependents for whom they have legal authority to consent to healthcare services. The adult user is responsible for all obligations under these Terms related to such bookings. Nothing in these Terms supersedes state laws regarding minors' ability to consent to certain healthcare services independently.

### 2.2 Account Creation

To book appointments or access certain features, you must create an account by providing accurate, current, and complete information. You agree to update your information promptly if it changes.

### 2.3 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to: (a) create a strong, unique password; (b) not share your login credentials with anyone; (c) notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or security breach; and (d) log out of your account after each session on shared devices.

### 2.4 One Account Per Person

Each individual may maintain only one account. Creating multiple accounts may result in termination of all accounts.

### 2.5 Accurate Information

You represent and warrant that all information you provide during registration and throughout your use of the Platform is accurate, truthful, and not misleading. Providing false information may result in account termination.

### 2.6 U.S. Residency

The Platform is currently available only to users located in the United States. By creating an account, you represent that you are a U.S. resident or are physically located in the United States at the time of use.

## SECTION 3: BOOKING AND APPOINTMENTS

### 3.1 Booking Process

You may book appointments with Providers through the Platform by selecting a Provider, service, date, and time. By completing a booking, you are requesting an appointment with the Provider subject to Provider availability and acceptance.

### 3.2 Booking Confirmation

A booking is confirmed when you receive a confirmation notification through the Platform and/or email. Until you receive confirmation, no appointment has been scheduled.

### 3.3 Provider's Right to Decline

Providers may decline or cancel bookings at their discretion. If a Provider cancels your booking, you will receive a full refund of any amounts paid (100% of deposit).

### 3.4 Your Responsibilities

You agree to: (a) arrive on time for scheduled appointments; (b) provide accurate health information as requested by the Provider; (c) follow reasonable instructions from the Provider; (d) treat Providers and their staff with respect; and (e) comply with the Provider's office policies.

### 3.5 Health Information

You may be required to provide health information directly to Providers. Any health information you share with Providers is subject to the Provider's privacy practices. Findr Health does not collect, store, or have access to your Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined under HIPAA. Findr Health is not a Covered Entity or Business Associate under HIPAA. Our collection of appointment scheduling information (Provider name, date, time, service type) is not Protected Health Information under HIPAA. Any clinical information, medical records, or treatment details are exchanged directly between you and Providers.

### 3.6 Booking for Others

You may book appointments for other individuals only if you have their authorization to do so and legal authority to consent to healthcare services on their behalf where required. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of information provided and for communicating booking details to the individual receiving services. You remain bound by all payment obligations for bookings made on behalf of others.

## SECTION 4: PAYMENTS AND FEES

### 4.1 Pricing

Providers set their own prices for services, which are displayed on the Platform. Prices shown are the cash-pay prices and do not include insurance. All prices are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.

### 4.2 80/20 Payment Model

**FINDR HEALTH USES AN 80/20 PAYMENT MODEL FOR ALL BOOKINGS. THIS MEANS:**

**80% Deposit (Charged Immediately)**  
Charged to your payment method when you confirm your booking.

**20% Final Payment (Charged After Service)**  
Automatically charged after Provider marks appointment complete.

**Example:** If you book a $150 service:
- At Booking: $120 charged immediately (80% deposit)
- After Service: $30 charged automatically (20% final payment)
- Total Cost: $150 (shown before booking)

**IMPORTANT:** Only the 80% deposit is eligible for refunds under our Cancellation Policy (Section 5). The 20% final payment is only charged after the Provider marks your appointment as completed.

### 4.3 Platform Fee Disclosure

Findr Health charges a platform fee to support operations, maintain the Platform, process payments, and provide customer support. The platform fee is calculated as follows:

**Platform Fee Structure:**
- Base Fee: 10% of service price
- Flat Fee: $1.50 per transaction
- Maximum Cap: $35.00 (regardless of service price)

**Examples of Platform Fee Calculation:**
- $50 service → Platform Fee: $6.50 (10% + $1.50) → Provider Receives: $43.50
- $100 service → Platform Fee: $11.50 (10% + $1.50) → Provider Receives: $88.50
- $150 service → Platform Fee: $16.50 (10% + $1.50) → Provider Receives: $133.50
- $400 service → Platform Fee: $35.00 (capped) → Provider Receives: $365.00

The platform fee is included in the total service price displayed to you and is not an additional charge. The fee breakdown is shown in your booking confirmation.

### 4.4 Payment Authorization

When you book an appointment, you authorize Findr Health to: (a) charge your payment method for the 80% deposit immediately upon booking confirmation; (b) save your payment method securely for the final payment; and (c) charge your saved payment method for the remaining 20% automatically after the Provider marks your appointment as completed.

### 4.5 Payment Processing

All payments are processed through Stripe, our third-party payment processor. By using the Platform, you agree to Stripe's terms of service. Findr Health does not store your complete credit card information. Your payment data is encrypted and securely stored by Stripe in compliance with PCI DSS requirements.

### 4.6 Additional Charges

Providers may recommend additional services beyond the originally booked service. Any additional charges require your explicit consent through the Platform before being processed. You will receive an itemized summary of additional charges and must approve them before your payment method is charged. You have the right to decline additional services without affecting your originally booked appointment.

### 4.7 Taxes

You are responsible for any applicable taxes on services purchased through the Platform. Taxes, if applicable, will be calculated and displayed at checkout.

### 4.8 Failed Payments

If your payment method is declined or fails for the initial 80% deposit, we will notify you and request updated payment information. Failure to provide valid payment information will result in cancellation of your booking. If the 20% final payment fails, we will attempt to process it up to three (3) times over a seven (7) day period. Continued payment failure may result in account restrictions and collection efforts.

### 4.9 Provider Payouts

After your appointment is completed and the final 20% payment is successfully charged, Findr Health will transfer the Provider's portion (total service price minus platform fee) to the Provider's designated account. Findr Health is not responsible for disputes between you and Providers regarding service quality or completion.

## SECTION 5: CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CANCELLATION POLICY

**FINDR HEALTH ENFORCES A STRICT BINARY 48-HOUR CANCELLATION POLICY. THERE ARE NO PARTIAL REFUNDS, NO EXCEPTIONS, AND NO FEE WAIVERS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ALL BOOKINGS PLATFORM-WIDE.**

### 5.1 Binary 48-Hour Policy

**FINDR HEALTH USES A BINARY CANCELLATION POLICY BASED SOLELY ON THE TIME BETWEEN CANCELLATION AND YOUR SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT:**

**✓ Cancel ≥48 hours before appointment**  
100% FULL REFUND of deposit

**✗ Cancel <48 hours before appointment**  
0% NO REFUND - Deposit forfeited

This is an "all or nothing" policy. You will either receive a 100% refund of your deposit or a 0% refund. There are NO partial refunds (75%, 50%, 25%, etc.) under any circumstances.

### 5.2 What Is Refundable

**ONLY THE 80% DEPOSIT IS ELIGIBLE FOR REFUNDS.** The 20% final payment is never charged until after your appointment is completed. If you cancel before the appointment:

- Cancel ≥48 hours before: You receive a full refund of the 80% deposit (100% refund)
- Cancel <48 hours before: You receive no refund and forfeit the 80% deposit (0% refund)
- The 20% final payment is never charged if you cancel before the appointment

**Example:** For a $150 service ($120 deposit), canceling 49 hours before results in a $120 refund. Canceling 47 hours before results in $0 refund and you forfeit the $120 deposit.

### 5.3 How Cancellation Time Is Calculated

The 48-hour threshold is calculated from the exact scheduled appointment time in the Provider's local timezone to the time you submit the cancellation through the Platform.

**Example Time Calculations:**
- Appointment: Monday 2:00 PM
- Cancel Saturday 1:59 PM → 48 hours 1 minute → 100% refund ✓
- Cancel Saturday 2:01 PM → 47 hours 59 minutes → 0% refund ✗

### 5.4 No Exceptions Policy

**THE 48-HOUR BINARY POLICY APPLIES UNIVERSALLY WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR:**

- Medical emergencies or hospitalizations
- Family emergencies or deaths
- Natural disasters or severe weather
- Car accidents or transportation failures
- Work obligations or schedule conflicts
- COVID-19, illness, or positive test results
- Childcare issues or family obligations
- First-time users or "goodwill" requests
- Technical issues with the Platform (unless caused by Findr Health)
- Provider recommendation to cancel

This policy is enforced by Findr Health automatically through our payment system. Providers do not have discretion to waive or modify this policy. Customer support cannot override this policy for any reason.

### 5.5 How to Cancel

You may cancel appointments through the Platform by: (a) accessing "My Bookings" in your account; (b) selecting the booking you wish to cancel; (c) tapping "Cancel Appointment"; and (d) confirming the cancellation. The Platform will display your refund amount (100% or 0%) before you confirm. Cancellation is effective immediately when you confirm through the Platform.

### 5.6 Refund Processing

If you are eligible for a refund (cancellation ≥48 hours before appointment):

- Refund Amount: 100% of the 80% deposit
- Refund Method: Original payment method only
- Processing Time: 5-10 business days (depends on your financial institution)
- Confirmation: You will receive an email confirmation with refund details

Refunds cannot be issued as cash, account credits, or to alternative payment methods. If your original payment method is no longer valid, contact support@findrhealth.com immediately.

### 5.7 Provider Cancellations

If a Provider cancels your appointment for any reason at any time, you will automatically receive a 100% refund of your deposit regardless of the 48-hour threshold. Provider cancellations are not subject to the binary policy. You will be notified via email and the Platform, and your refund will be processed within 5-10 business days.

### 5.8 No-Shows

If you fail to appear for a scheduled appointment without prior cancellation ("No-Show"):

- You forfeit the 80% deposit (no refund)
- The 20% final payment may still be charged at Provider discretion
- Repeated no-shows may result in account restrictions or termination

If a Provider fails to appear for a confirmed appointment ("Provider No-Show"), report it through the Platform within 48 hours. You will receive a 100% refund of any amounts charged.

### 5.9 Reschedule vs. Cancellation

Rescheduling an appointment is treated as a cancellation of the original appointment followed by a new booking. The 48-hour cancellation policy applies to the original appointment time. If you reschedule within 48 hours of the original appointment, you will forfeit the deposit (0% refund) and will be charged a new 80% deposit for the rescheduled appointment.

### 5.10 Disputes and Errors

If you believe your cancellation was processed incorrectly or the refund calculation was in error:

- Contact Findr Health support at support@findrhealth.com within seven (7) days
- Provide your booking number and cancellation confirmation
- Explain why you believe the policy was applied incorrectly
- We will review and respond within fourteen (14) business days

Disputes about policy fairness, extenuating circumstances, or requests for exceptions will not be granted. Disputes are only for technical or calculation errors. This dispute process does not affect your rights under applicable consumer protection laws or your card issuer's chargeback process.

### 5.11 Acknowledgment

**BY BOOKING AN APPOINTMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THIS BINARY 48-HOUR CANCELLATION POLICY. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE NO PARTIAL REFUNDS, NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ANY REASON, AND NO PROVIDER DISCRETION TO WAIVE FEES. YOU ACCEPT FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CANCELLATIONS MADE LESS THAN 48 HOURS BEFORE YOUR SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT.**
