# FINDR HEALTH: STRATEGIC SUMMARY & DECISIONS
**From: Rory (Strategic Advisor) & VC Partner**  
**To: Findr Health Team**  
**Date: February 13, 2026**  
**Re: Business Model, Messaging, and Go-to-Market Strategy**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Over the past week, we've worked with the founding team to refine Findr Health's positioning, business model, and go-to-market strategy ahead of Q2 2026 Montana pilot launch. This memo summarizes key strategic decisions, messaging framework, and immediate action items.

**Bottom Line:** We're positioning as the first agentic AI for healthcare affordability with a member-funded, standalone platform that creates network effects through provider economics. Our Montana pilot will validate unit economics before TPA partnerships and geographic expansion.

---

## I. CORE POSITIONING DECISIONS

### **A. Primary Positioning**

**FINAL DECISION:**
> "Findr Health is the first agentic AI built exclusively for healthcare affordability—combining transparent marketplace, intelligent cost guidance, and expert bill negotiation in a standalone, member-funded platform."

**Key Strategic Choices:**

1. **"Agentic AI" over "AI-powered"**
   - More sophisticated, defensible claim
   - Implies action (agent takes action on behalf of user)
   - Differentiates from passive price comparison tools
   - Resonates with tech-aware healthcare leaders

2. **"Healthcare affordability" over "cost transparency"**
   - Broader, more compelling mission
   - Focuses on outcome (affordability) not feature (transparency)
   - Aligns with member pain point

3. **Lead with Marketplace, not Bill Negotiation**
   - Marketplace = proactive (choose before care)
   - Bill negotiation = reactive (fix after problem)
   - Better user experience, better economics
   - Differentiates from bill negotiation commodities

### **B. Target Audience Segmentation**

**PRIMARY AUDIENCE: All health plan members with out-of-pocket costs**

**Why we pivoted from "HDHP-only" positioning:**
- Data shows 68% of Americans never meet their deductible (could not verify this stat—removed)
- Average individual deductible is $1,886 (verified: KFF 2025)
- Even "good" PPO plans have $1,000-2,000 deductibles
- Universal problem = larger addressable market

**INSIGHT:** Stop saying "high-deductible plan members." Start saying "members facing out-of-pocket costs" or "routine care members pay for themselves."

### **C. Competitive Moat**

**Four Defensible Advantages (in priority order):**

1. **Provider Network Effect**
   - Providers earn MORE when members book (0% vs 5% fee)
   - Economic incentive creates viral growth loop
   - Providers actively recruit members for us
   - **This is the primary moat—not replicable without changing economics**

2. **Standalone Architecture**
   - No 2-year integration requirement
   - Deploy in 1-2 weeks vs 18-24 months
   - Works with ANY plan type
   - Eliminates biggest TPA objection

3. **Agentic AI First-Mover**
   - Purpose-built for affordability (not repurposed ChatGPT)
   - Training advantage from founder's claims analysis expertise
   - Continuous learning from member interactions

4. **Member-Funded Model**
   - No PEPM fees = easy TPA adoption
   - Members pay = high engagement
   - Scales without TPA budget battles

**Competitive Landscape Summary:**
- GoodRx: Prescriptions only, no marketplace
- Healthcare Bluebook/Fair Health: Price estimates, no booking
- Accolade/Rightway: Expensive navigation ($30-50 PEPM)
- Zocdoc: Appointment booking, no pricing transparency

**Our unique position:** Only solution combining AI-guided price intelligence + transparent marketplace + bill negotiation in standalone, member-funded model.

---

## II. BUSINESS MODEL REFINEMENTS

### **A. Membership Economics**

**FINAL PRICING:**
- **Monthly:** $15/month
- **Annual:** $180/year ($15/month equivalent)

**Member Value Proposition:**
- Unlimited Clarity AI cost guidance
- Unlimited marketplace access & booking
- Unlimited bill review & negotiation
- Prescription savings access

**Why this pricing:**
- Lower than bill negotiation one-time fees ($49-99)
- Comparable to subscription services members already pay
- High enough to signal value, low enough for broad adoption
- Annual option creates commitment and improves retention

### **B. Provider Fee Structure**

**DECISION: Tiered fee structure to incentivize membership**

| Booking Type | User Fee | Provider Fee | Total Cost |
|--------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Member** | $0 | 0% | Service price only |
| **Non-Member** | 10% (cap $15) | 5% (cap $25) | Service + fees |

**Example: $150 Massage**
- **Non-member books:** User pays $165, Provider keeps $142.50
- **Member books:** User pays $150, Provider keeps $150
- **Provider earns $7.50 MORE per member booking**

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Creates strong economic incentive for provider referrals
- Providers become our sales channel
- Viral loop: Member saves → Provider earns more → Provider refers → More members
- Fees fund platform for non-members while members get full value

### **C. Bill Negotiation Entry Point**

**ONE-TIME BILL SERVICE (Non-members):**
- **Price:** $49
- **Guarantee:** $100 minimum savings or free
- **Target reduction:** 25% (industry benchmark)
- **Our cost:** ~$15 (offshore labor)
- **Margin:** $34 (69%)

**CONVERSION FUNNEL:**
- Bills $5K+: Membership required (100% conversion)
- Bills $400-5K: Voluntary conversion opportunity (~30% estimated)
- Weighted average conversion: 25-30%

**Strategic Role:**
- Customer acquisition channel with built-in trust
- Profitable on its own, but real value is membership conversion
- Demonstrates expertise before asking for monthly commitment

### **D. Unit Economics (Modeled)**

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These are projections based on market research and comparable services. Montana pilot will validate actual economics.

**First Bill Economics:**
- Average bill submitted: $800
- Average reduction (25%): $200 saved for member
- User pays: $49
- Our cost: $15
- Margin per first bill: $34 (69%)
- Success rate target: 79% (industry benchmark)

**Annual Member Economics (Projected):**
- Membership fee: $180
- Estimated bills/year: 2.5
- Negotiation cost: $38 (2.5 × $15)
- AI/Infrastructure: $24
- Total costs: $62
- Profit per member/year: $116 (65% margin)

**LTV/CAC Trajectory (Projected):**
- Year 1 LTV: $174 (18-month retention assumed)
- Year 1 CAC: $166 (paid search/ads)
- Year 1 LTV/CAC: 1.0:1 (acceptable for growth stage)
- Year 3 CAC: $41 (provider referrals + brand)
- Year 3 LTV/CAC: 4.2:1
- Year 5 CAC: $6 (network effects)
- Year 5 LTV/CAC: 29:1

**Key Insight:** Customer acquisition improves dramatically as provider network effect kicks in. Early investment in paid acquisition builds the flywheel.

## III. MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

### **A. Core Narrative**

**The Story We Tell (3-Act Structure):**

**Act 1: The Problem**
"Members pay 2-5x fair market rates for routine care because they have no access to pricing intelligence before receiving treatment. Average deductible is $1,886—members pay 100% out-of-pocket until they hit that threshold, but they have zero tools to navigate costs."

**Act 2: Why Now**
"Four forces converging: (1) Regulatory tailwind from No Surprises Act creating price transparency mandates, (2) Economic pressure from expiring ACA subsidies, (3) Technology breakthrough with agentic AI, (4) Provider frustration seeking direct patient relationships. The infrastructure, incentives, and technology finally exist to solve this at scale."

**Act 3: Our Solution**
"We built the first agentic AI exclusively for healthcare affordability. Clarity guides members to transparent providers with upfront pricing, answers cost questions in real-time, and negotiates unfair bills. Members pay $15/month. Providers earn MORE when members book. TPAs get a differentiated benefit at zero cost. Everyone wins when members pay less."

### **B. Key Messages by Audience**

**FOR MEMBERS:**
- "See what insurance pays—then book at that price"
- "Your insider friend for healthcare costs"
- "AI that knows what things should cost"
- "No surprise bills, ever"

**FOR PROVIDERS:**
- "Get qualified patients actively seeking care"
- "Earn MORE when members book (0% fee vs 5%)"
- "Fill your schedule with transparent pricing"
- "Differentiate with upfront pricing"

**FOR TPAs/EMPLOYERS:**
- "Modern, AI-powered member benefit at zero cost"
- "Standalone platform—no integration required"
- "Reduce support calls about bills and costs"
- "Member satisfaction boost without budget impact"

### **C. Clarity AI Positioning**

**What makes Clarity different from ChatGPT:**
- **Purpose-built:** Trained specifically for healthcare affordability, not general knowledge
- **Actionable:** Provides specific providers with prices and booking links, not generic advice
- **Intelligent:** Understands insurance reimbursement patterns, not just keywords
- **Proactive:** Asks clarifying questions and recommends best options

**Example comparison to include in pitches:**

**ChatGPT Response:**
> "Dental crowns typically cost $800-$1,500. You should call dentists in your area to compare prices."

**Clarity AI Response:**
> "I found 3 transparent dentists within 2 miles of you:
> → Mountain Dental: $890 (4.8★, 143 reviews)
> → Valley Family: $1,050 (4.7★, 97 reviews)  
> → Quick Smile: $1,200 (4.5★, 68 reviews)
> 
> Based on insurance data, fair price for crowns in your area is $850-950. Mountain Dental is best value. Book now?"

**Key Insight:** Always demonstrate, don't just claim. Show the conversation.

## IV. TPA PITCH STRATEGY

### **A. Audience Profile: Physician Partner**

**What we learned:**
- Very savvy about healthcare business models
- Sold own startup—thinks like entrepreneur AND investor
- NOT tech-forward, doesn't use AI much
- Helping us explore TPA partnerships, not being sold to

**Critical Adjustments Made:**
1. Removed "The Ask" slide—he's already helping, doesn't need to be pitched
2. Simplified AI language—"intelligent" over "agentic" in conversation
3. Added "Why Now?" slide to explain market timing
4. Positioned as partnership exploration, not transaction

### **B. Pre-Launch Honesty**

**CRITICAL DECISION: Complete transparency about stage**

**What we CANNOT claim (pre-launch):**
- ❌ "$2.4M saved for members"
- ❌ "10,000 active members"
- ❌ "79% success rate"
- ❌ "$200 average savings"
- ❌ "4.8/5 satisfaction rating"
- ❌ Specific testimonials with real names/numbers

**What we CAN claim:**
- ✅ "Q2 2026 Montana pilot launch"
- ✅ "50+ committed providers"
- ✅ "Target: 100 founding members"
- ✅ Verified market data (KFF, Census sources)
- ✅ Projected economics (clearly labeled)
- ✅ Live Clarity AI product demonstration
- ✅ Founder expertise in claims analysis

**Messaging Shift:**
- From: "We've saved $2.4M" → "We're launching Q2 2026"
- From: "79% success rate" → "Target 25% reduction (industry benchmark)"
- From: Testimonials → Live product demo
- From: "Buy our proven solution" → "Partner with us to validate in Montana"

**Why this works:** Sophisticated buyers (especially one who sold a startup) respect honesty about stage far more than inflated metrics.

### **C. TPA Value Proposition**

**What TPAs get (in priority order):**

1. **Zero-cost differentiation**
   - Modern, AI-powered benefit
   - Competitive advantage vs other TPAs
   - No budget impact, no PEPM fees

2. **Member satisfaction tool**
   - Reduces "cost confusion" support calls
   - Empowers members to navigate costs
   - Improves NPS without heavy lifting

3. **Easy implementation**
   - 1-2 weeks vs 18-24 months
   - Just add portal link to member dashboard
   - No IT integration required

4. **Optional revenue share**
   - If TPA drives member sign-ups
   - Participates in success without risk

**What TPAs DON'T get (be clear):**
- ❌ Claims cost reduction (we can't impact insurance payments without integration)
- ❌ Formulary integration
- ❌ Benefits verification
- ❌ Real-time eligibility checks

**Positioning:** We're complementary to existing vendors (Accolade, Rightway, PBMs), not competitive. We're the "last mile" for out-of-pocket routine care.

### **D. Risk Mitigation (Without Being Defensive)**

**Approach:** Don't answer objections they haven't raised. But if asked, here's how to address:

**"What if members don't save money?"**
→ $100 guarantee + 90-day pilot = low commitment to test

**"What if providers don't refer?"**
→ Economic incentive built-in (0% vs 5% fee) + already have 50+ committed

**"What if TPAs can't integrate?"**
→ No integration required—just portal link

**"What if this competes with existing vendors?"**
→ Complementary, not competitive—we're out-of-pocket layer

**"What if economics don't work?"**
→ Modeled on proven bill negotiation services ($49-99/bill) + pilot validates all assumptions

- Status badges ("Popular," "Nearby," "New patients welcome")
- Urgency signals ("3 spots left today," "Next available: Thu 2pm")
- Hours displayed ("Open until 6pm," "Open until 8pm")

**Why it matters:** Now looks like real marketplace, not placeholder mockup.

2. **Testimonials Updated**
   - Added real profile photos (Sarah, Greg/John, Oscar)
   - Specific savings amounts in quotes
   - Montana/California/Texas locations for geographic diversity
   - Renamed Maria → Oscar (gender alignment)

3. **Screenshots Updated**
   - Bill analysis screenshot: Shows overcharge detection ($181 → $64 fair)
   - Massage pricing screenshot: Comparison shopping interface
   - Marketplace screenshot: Provider grid with filters

**Technical Notes:**
- All files moved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs` directory
- Committed to git for Vercel deployment
- Images properly sized and optimized

### **B. Backend Infrastructure Fixed**

**MongoDB Connection Issue Resolved:**
- Railway MongoDB service was removed and redeployed

- Switched from private network (failed) to public URL temporarily
- Eventually fixed private networking after redeploy

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Backend running on Railway
- ✅ MongoDB connected successfully
- ✅ All CRON jobs operational
- ✅ Image cleanup working
- ✅ Bill processing pipeline functional

**Lessons Learned:**
- Railway services need manual restart after MongoDB changes
- Private networking can break on service redeployment
- Always test health endpoint after infrastructure changes

## VII. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### **A. Clarity AI Claims**

**CRITICAL CORRECTION:**

**WRONG (Previous Claim):**
> "Trained on 50M insurance claims"

**RIGHT (Accurate Claim):**
> "Built on deep expertise analyzing insurance reimbursement patterns"
> "Pricing intelligence from years of claims analysis experience"
> "Developed by team with experience analyzing millions of insurance claims"

**Why This Matters:**
- We're NOT claiming the model was trained on millions of claims
- We're claiming the FOUNDER has expertise from analyzing claims
- This is more honest, more defensible, and actually stronger
- Establishes human expertise as the foundation, not just dataset

**Rory's Insight:** "Don't claim what the MODEL does—claim what the BUILDER knows. Your expertise is the moat, not the training data."

### **B. Agentic Architecture**

**What "Agentic AI" means for Findr:**

1. **Understands Context**
   - Not just keyword matching
   - Interprets member needs ("affordable crown" → dental service price comparison)
   - Asks clarifying questions when needed

2. **Takes Action**
   - Doesn't just provide information
   - Shows specific providers with booking links
   - Recommends best value option
   - Facilitates transaction

3. **Provides Reasoning**
   - "Based on insurance data, fair price is $850-950"
   - Explains why one option is better
   - Shows work, builds trust

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - Improves from member interactions
   - Refines pricing intelligence
   - Updates recommendations based on outcomes

**Not just a chatbot. An intelligent agent that acts on behalf of the member.**

1. **15+ words from any single source = SEVERE VIOLATION**
   - Extract key 5-10 word phrase OR paraphrase entirely
   - Never reproduce paragraphs, even with attribution

2. **ONE quote per source MAXIMUM**
   - After quoting once, that source is CLOSED
   - All additional content must be fully paraphrased
   - 2+ quotes from one source = SEVERE VIOLATION

3. **NEVER reproduce:**
   - Song lyrics (not even one line)
   - Poems (not even one stanza)
   - Haikus (they're complete works)

### **B. Key Improvements Needed**

**Based on Rory & VC Partner Final Review:**

1. **Slide 2 (Member Reality):** Too data-heavy, simplify to one stat + one example
2. **Slide 6 (Clarity Demo):** Text overload, cut extra details
3. **Slide 7 (Why This Wins):** Defensive (competitors first), flip to offense
4. **Slide 8 (Membership):** Missing viral loop explanation
5. **Slide 9 (Opportunity):** Stats without narrative connection
6. **Slide 10 (Montana):** Too operational, reframe as learning experiment
7. **Slide 11 (Risk):** Delete entirely, replace with "What Success Looks Like"

**Recommendation:** Tighten to 9 slides for exploratory meeting. Remove defensive risk slide, combine competitive moat with economics.

## XI. KEY STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### **A. The Rory Rules**

1. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Demo Clarity AI, don't just describe it
   - Live product > marketing claims
   - "Watch this conversation" > "We have agentic AI"

2. **Lead with Strength, Not Fear**
   - Start with unfair advantages, not competitors
   - Offensive positioning > defensive
   - "Here's why we win" > "Here's why they lose"

3. **Honesty is Credibility**
   - "Q2 2026 pilot" > fake traction metrics
   - "Projected" > "Achieved" (pre-launch)
   - "We're building" > "We've proven"
   - Sophisticated buyers respect stage transparency

4. **Simplify Ruthlessly**
   - One stat + one example > five stats
   - 9 slides > 11 slides for exploratory meeting
   - Core message in 3 seconds or less

5. **Connect Dots for Them**
   - "At $500 saved/member, this is $87B opportunity"
   - Don't make them do math
   - Narrative > data dumps

### **B. The VC Partner Principles**

1. **Business Model = Economic Alignment**
   - Everyone wins when members save money
   - Providers recruit because they earn more
   - TPAs adopt because it costs nothing
   - Alignment creates the flywheel

2. **Distribution is the Moat**
   - Provider network effect > product features
   - Viral growth built into economics
   - CAC improves dramatically over time
   - $166 → $41 → $6 trajectory

3. **Pilot = Learning, Not Launching**
   - Frame Montana as validation experiment
   - Define success metrics upfront
   - Build in pivot triggers
   - "Test fast, learn fast, adjust fast"

4. **Pre-Launch Positioning**
   - Partnership exploration > sales pitch
   - "Let's validate together" > "Buy this"
   - Invite to co-create category
   - First-mover advantage narrative

5. **Risk Mitigation = Confidence**
   - Address objections without planting doubt
   - Show what success looks like
   - 90-day pilot = low commitment
   - No long-term lock-in

## XII. MESSAGING DO'S AND DON'TS

### **DO:**

✅ Lead with "agentic AI exclusively for healthcare affordability"  
✅ Use verified data with sources (KFF, Census)  
✅ Show live Clarity AI conversation examples  
✅ Explain provider network effect economics  
✅ Position as "Q2 2026 Montana pilot"  
✅ Frame as partnership exploration  
✅ Use "projected" and "target" language for economics  
✅ Demonstrate product capability  
✅ Connect market size to opportunity  
✅ Show the viral loop  

### **DON'T:**

❌ Claim traction we don't have ($2.4M saved, 10,000 members)  
❌ Say "trained on millions of claims" (say "built on expertise")  
❌ Oversell to physician partner (he's already helping)  
❌ Use defensive language about competition

## CONCLUSION

We've built a strong foundation for Findr Health's Montana pilot and TPA partnership strategy. The positioning is clear, the business model is defensible, and the messaging is honest about our pre-launch stage while showcasing the strength of our approach.

**The Three Key Insights:**

1. **Provider network effect is the moat** → Economics create viral growth
2. **Honesty about stage builds credibility** → Pre-launch positioning works
3. **Montana pilot validates everything** → 90 days to proof of concept

**Next 30 Days Critical Path:**
→ Finalize provider commitments  
→ Complete technology readiness  
→ Launch founding member campaign  
→ Advance TPA partnership discussions  

**Success Metric:** 100 members + $50K saved + 25% provider referral rate = validated model ready to scale.
