## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Strategic Assessment:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **EXCEPTIONAL PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY**

MedImpact and Findr Health represent a **rare alignment of incentives** in the healthcare market. Unlike the Big 3 PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, Optum Rx) that face regulatory scrutiny for lack of transparency, MedImpact's independent business model and **focus on member experience** creates a natural partnership opportunity with Findr Health's transparency mission.

### The Core Opportunity

**For MedImpact:**
- Differentiate from Big 3 competitors through **radical transparency**
- Improve medication adherence (key CMS Star Ratings metric)
- Reduce member services costs through AI-powered education
- Drive members to preferred pharmacy networks and mail-order
- Demonstrate alignment with plan sponsors (employers/health plans)

**For Findr Health:**
- Access to 50+ million covered lives
- Pharmacy pricing data integration
- Revenue share on pharmacy transactions
- Credibility through enterprise partnership
- Distribution channel for Clarity tools

### The Partnership Model

**White-Label Clarity AI Integration** → MedImpact member portal and mobile app  
**Clarity Price for Bills** → Post-service pharmacy bill negotiation  
**Preferred Provider Network** → Drive to MedImpact-advantaged pharmacies  
**Data Exchange** → Real-time formulary, copay, and pricing information

## PART 1: UNDERSTANDING MEDIMPACT

### 1.1 Business Model & Competitive Position

**MedImpact Profile:**
- **Size:** Largest independent PBM (~6th largest overall)
- **Lives Covered:** 50+ million members
- **Market Position:** "Trend-focused" PBM emphasizing transparency
- **Revenue Model:** Administrative fees + rebates + mail/specialty pharmacy
- **Differentiation:** No retail pharmacy ownership (unlike CVS, Optum)

**Key Difference from Big 3:**
> "Our business model is unique. MedImpact offers all the services you need from a PBM – with different goals for different outcomes than other PBMs. Our independent business model, prioritization of member experience and inherent flexibility allows us to align with plan sponsors in ways that other PBMs and their misaligned incentives cannot."

**Translation:** MedImpact positions itself as the **"good guy PBM"** that doesn't have conflicts of interest from owning retail pharmacies or being part of a vertically integrated health insurance conglomerate.

**Recent Innovation:**
- **OnePrice PMPM Model** (Jan 2025): Puts entire administrative fee at risk if cost targets not met
- Demonstrates commitment to **transparency and accountability**
- Rare in PBM industry (most hide behind complex pricing)

---

### 1.2 MedImpact's Business Priorities

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Lowest-Net-Cost Outcomes** - Not just rebates, but true plan savings
2. **Medication Adherence** - Especially for chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol)
3. **Member Satisfaction** - Differentiate through consumer experience
4. **CMS Star Ratings** - Critical for Medicare Part D business
5. **Plan Sponsor Retention** - Prove value vs. Big 3 competitors

**Key Metrics They Track:**
- Medication adherence rates (CMS Star Ratings driver)
- Generic dispensing rate (GDR)
- Cost per member per month (PMPM)
- Member services call volume and resolution
- Mail-order penetration rate
- Specialty medication adherence

**Pain Points:**
1. **Member confusion** about copays, deductibles, formularies
2. **High member services costs** (call centers, support)
3. **Medication abandonment** at pharmacy counter (sticker shock)
4. **Competition** from Big 3 with more resources
5. **Regulatory pressure** for transparency (though less than Big 3)

---

### 1.3 How PBMs Make Money

Understanding PBM revenue is critical to identifying partnership value:

**Revenue Stream 1: Administrative Fees**
- Charged to health plans/employers
- Typically $3-$8 per member per month
- MedImpact: ~$150-$400M/year (50M members x $3-8 PMPM)

**Revenue Stream 2: Rebates**
- Drug manufacturers pay to secure formulary placement
- Can be 20-50% of drug's list price
- **Traditional PBM Model:** Keep most rebates, pass through small %
- **MedImpact Model:** Claims to pass through more (not verified)

**Revenue Stream 3: Spread Pricing**
- PBM charges plan sponsor $100 for drug
- PBM pays pharmacy $80
- PBM keeps $20 "spread"
- **Increasingly scrutinized** by regulators

**Revenue Stream 4: Mail-Order Pharmacy**
- MedImpact operates "Birdi" mail pharmacy
- 90-day supply orders (higher margin)
- Convenience for members, revenue for PBM

**Revenue Stream 5: Specialty Pharmacy**
- "MedImpact Direct Specialty"
- High-cost drugs (cancer, MS, etc.)
- Higher margins due to complexity

**Total Annual Revenue (Estimated):**
- ~$1.5-2.5 billion (private company, not disclosed)
- Compared to: CVS Caremark ~$170B, Express Scripts ~$120B, Optum Rx ~$110B

## PART 2: HOW CLARITY TOOLS BENEFIT MEDIMPACT

### 2.1 Clarity AI - Strategic Value Proposition

**Core Capability:** Interactive LLM that explains pharmacy benefits, calculates insurance vs. cash-pay decisions, and guides medication decisions.

#### Benefit #1: Reduce Member Services Costs (HIGH VALUE)

**Current State:**
- PBMs operate call centers to answer member questions
- Cost: $5-$15 per call
- Volume: Millions of calls annually
- Topics: "Why is my copay so high?", "Is this drug covered?", "What's my deductible?"

**With Clarity AI:**
- Self-service answers 24/7 (no wait times)
- Cost: $0.01-0.10 per interaction (99% cheaper)
- Instant responses (vs. 10-15 min hold times)
- Consistent, accurate information
- Tracks common questions for formulary optimization

**Financial Impact:**
```
Current Call Center Costs:
50M members x 0.5 calls/year = 25M calls
25M calls x $10/call = $250M/year

With Clarity AI (80% deflection):
20M calls deflected = $200M saved
5M calls remain = $50M cost
Net Savings: $200M/year (80% reduction)

ROI on Findr Health Partnership: 100-500x
```

---

#### Benefit #2: Improve Medication Adherence (CRITICAL VALUE)

**Why This Matters:**
- Non-adherence costs U.S. healthcare $300B/year
- MedImpact's CMS Star Ratings depend on adherence metrics
- Higher ratings = more Medicare members = more revenue

**Current Adherence Barriers:**
1. **Cost Confusion:** "Can I afford this?"
2. **Formulary Complexity:** "Is there a cheaper alternative?"
3. **Prior Authorization:** "Why was this denied?"
4. **Sticker Shock:** "I'm not paying $150 for this!"

**Clarity AI Solution:**

**Scenario 1: Atorvastatin (Cholesterol)**
```
Member at Pharmacy Counter:
"Your copay is $45"

Member thinks: "That's expensive. I'll skip it."
→ Medication abandonment
→ Poor adherence
→ Lower CMS Star Rating

WITH CLARITY AI:
Member texts: "Why is my cholesterol med $45?"

Clarity AI responds:
"Your plan has a deductible. You've paid $200 of $500 so far.
After you hit $500, this will drop to $10.
Or, I can find you a $4 generic at Walmart instead.
Would you like me to transfer your prescription?"

→ Member understands
→ Transfers to $4 generic
→ Takes medication
→ Adherence improved
→ CMS Star Rating increases
```

**Financial Impact:**
```
CMS Star Rating Improvement:
4.0 → 4.5 stars = 10-15% more Medicare members

Current Medicare Business: ~20M members (40% of 50M)
Revenue per member: ~$30 PMPM = $360/year
Total Medicare Revenue: $7.2B/year

15% increase = 3M additional members
3M x $360 = $1.08B additional revenue/year

Investment in Clarity AI: ~$10-20M/year
ROI: 50-100x
```

---

#### Benefit #3: Drive to Preferred Networks (STRATEGIC VALUE)

**PBM Network Strategy:**
- PBMs negotiate discounts with pharmacy chains
- "Preferred networks" offer lower copays
- Members often don't know this
- Result: Higher costs for plan and member

**Clarity AI Network Steering:**

**Conversation Example:**
```
Member: "I need to fill my diabetes medication. Where should I go?"

Clarity AI:
"Your plan has preferred pharmacy pricing:

💚 Preferred Network (save $15):
   - Walmart: 2.3 miles, $10 copay
   - Costco: 4.1 miles, $10 copay
   
🟨 Standard Network:
   - CVS: 0.8 miles, $25 copay
   - Walgreens: 1.2 miles, $25 copay

You'll save $15 at Walmart or Costco. Want directions?"

Member: "Yes, Walmart please"
→ Clarity AI provides directions
→ Member fills at preferred network
→ MedImpact saves $15 on reimbursement
→ Member saves $15 on copay
→ Win-win
```

**Financial Impact:**
```
Scenario: Preferred Network Cost Differential

Standard Network Reimbursement: $100
Preferred Network Reimbursement: $85
Savings per Rx: $15

If Clarity AI drives 10% of members to preferred:
50M members x 12 Rx/year = 600M Rx/year
10% shift = 60M Rx
60M Rx x $15 savings = $900M/year savings

Split with Findr Health (50/50): $450M each
Findr Health partnership cost: ~$50M/year
Net Benefit to MedImpact: $400M/year
```

---

#### Benefit #4: Drive Mail-Order Adoption (HIGH MARGIN)

**Current Challenge:**
- Mail-order has higher margins for PBMs
- But members resist (perceived inconvenience)
- Adoption rates: 15-25% of maintenance meds

**Clarity AI Mail-Order Promotion:**

**Conversation Example:**
```
Member: "My blood pressure meds cost $60/month"

Clarity AI:
"You're paying retail prices. Here's how to save:

📬 Switch to Mail Order (90-day supply):
   - Cost: $100 for 3 months (vs. $180 retail)
   - Save: $80/year on this medication
   - Free delivery to your door
   - Auto-refills (never run out)
   
Would you like me to set this up? I can transfer
your prescription from Walgreens right now."

Member: "Yes, that saves money and I don't have to remember refills"
→ Switches to mail-order
→ MedImpact increases mail-order penetration
→ Higher margins
→ Better adherence
→ Win-win
```

**Financial Impact:**
```
Mail-Order Economics:

Retail Rx Margin: 5-10%
Mail-Order Rx Margin: 15-25% (higher due to 90-day fills)

Current Mail-Order Rate: 20%
Target with Clarity AI: 35%

600M total Rx/year x 40% maintenance meds = 240M maintenance Rx
Current mail-order: 48M Rx (20%)
Target mail-order: 84M Rx (35%)
Increase: 36M Rx

Margin increase: 36M x $10 additional margin = $360M/year
```

---

#### Benefit #5: Competitive Differentiation (BRAND VALUE)

**Market Positioning Challenge:**
- Big 3 PBMs under fire for lack of transparency
- FTC investigation into business practices
- 45 states passed PBM regulation laws
- Plan sponsors demanding transparency

**MedImpact's Opportunity:**

> "Unlike the Big 3, we offer **Clarity AI** - your personal pharmacy benefits advisor available 24/7 to help you understand your benefits, find the lowest-cost options, and make informed decisions about your medications."

**Marketing Message:**
- **CVS Caremark:** Part of CVS Pharmacy (conflict of interest)
- **Express Scripts:** Part of Cigna Insurance (conflict of interest)  
- **Optum Rx:** Part of UnitedHealthcare (conflict of interest)
- **MedImpact:** Independent + Transparent + Clarity AI (aligned with members)

**Sales Impact:**
- Win new plan sponsor RFPs by offering superior member experience
- Reduce churn of existing clients
- Command premium pricing (or accept lower admin fees to win business)

---

### 2.2 Clarity Price - Strategic Value Proposition

**Core Capability:** Analyzes post-service pharmacy bills, explains pricing, provides negotiation scripts for prompt-pay discounts.

#### Use Case #1: Specialty Medication Sticker Shock

**Scenario: Member picks up cancer medication**

**Current State:**
```
Pharmacist: "That'll be $3,500"

Member: "WHAT?! I can't afford that!"

Member either:
1. Abandons medication (non-adherence)
2. Calls member services (angry, confused)
3. Files complaint
4. Switches PBMs (churn risk)
```

**With Clarity Price:**
```
Member uploads bill via Findr Health app:
"Keytruda - $3,500 copay"

Clarity Price analyzes:
✅ Verifies bill accuracy
✅ Checks if deductible applies
✅ Identifies copay assistance programs
✅ Provides negotiation script

Response:
"Your bill is accurate - you're in your deductible phase.
Here's how to reduce this:

1. Manufacturer Copay Card: Covers up to $25,000/year
   → Link to enroll: [URL]
   → This drops your cost to $0

2. Patient Assistance Program: If you qualify (income-based)
   → Free medication through Merck foundation

3. Alternative: Ask doctor about biosimilar (not yet available)

Would you like me to help you apply for the copay card?"

Member: "Yes please"
→ Enrolls in copay card
→ Returns to pharmacy
→ Cost: $0 instead of $3,500
→ Takes medication
→ Adherence maintained
→ Member satisfaction high
→ No churn risk
```

**Financial Impact:**
```
Specialty Med Abandonment Reduction:

Current abandonment rate: 15% of specialty prescriptions
Specialty Rx volume: ~5M Rx/year (1% of 600M total)
Cost per abandoned Rx: $3,000 average

Abandoned Rx cost to plan: 15% x 5M x $3,000 = $2.25B/year

With Clarity Price (reduce abandonment by 50%):
Prevented abandonments: 375,000 Rx
Improved health outcomes: Priceless
Reduced member complaints: 375,000 calls avoided
Cost savings to MedImpact: $3.75M (calls) + improved retention

ROI: High member satisfaction, reduced churn, better adherence
```

---

#### Use Case #2: Generic vs. Brand Education

**Scenario: Member confused why costs vary**

**Current Experience:**
```
Member: Picks up Lipitor (brand) for $120/month

Next month: Doctor switches to Atorvastatin (generic)
Cost: $4/month

Member thinks: "Why did I pay $120 last month?! 
Is my PBM ripping me off?"
```

**With Clarity Price:**
```
Member uploads both bills

Clarity Price explains:
"Great question! Here's what happened:

Last Month:
- Lipitor (brand name) = $120 copay
- Your plan encourages generics (lower cost)
- Brand copay tier = higher price

This Month:
- Atorvastatin (generic) = $4 copay
- Same medication, same effectiveness
- Savings: $1,392/year

Your plan's formulary prioritizes generics because:
1. Same active ingredient
2. FDA-approved equivalent
3. 95%+ cost savings

You're now on the lowest-cost option! 🎉"

Member: "Oh, that makes sense. Thanks!"
→ Educated member
→ No complaint
→ Trust in PBM maintained
```

```

---

### 3.2 Clarity Price - Pharmacy Bill Integration

**How Clarity Price Drives MedImpact Revenue:**

MedImpact does NOT want members negotiating with pharmacies they've already contracted with (that would undermine MedImpact's negotiated rates). However...

**Strategic Use Case: Specialty Medications**

**Problem:**
- Specialty pharmacies (Accredo, CVS Specialty, Walgreens Specialty) often have:
  - High costs
  - Poor service
  - Limited patient support

**Opportunity:**
- MedImpact operates "MedImpact Direct Specialty" pharmacy
- Wants to capture more specialty Rx volume
- Higher margins + better member experience

**Clarity Price Pivot:**

Instead of "negotiate with the pharmacy," Clarity Price becomes:

**"Specialty Rx Cost Optimizer"**

```
Member uploads specialty pharmacy bill:
"Accredo Specialty - Humira: $1,200 copay"

Clarity Price analyzes and suggests:

"💡 You can reduce this cost:

Option 1: Switch to MedImpact Direct Specialty
- Same medication
- Free delivery
- Clinical support included
- Copay assistance enrollment help
- Estimated copay: $10 (with copay card we'll help you apply for)

Option 2: Manufacturer Copay Card (current pharmacy)
- Reduces copay to $5
- Link to apply: [URL]

Option 3: Patient Assistance Program (if income-qualified)
- Free medication

Recommendation: Switch to MedImpact Direct Specialty + copay card
→ Best support + lowest cost

Would you like me to start the transfer?"

Member: "Yes"
→ Clicks button
→ Prescription transfers to MedImpact Direct Specialty
→ MedImpact captures specialty Rx
→ Higher margin for MedImpact
→ Lower cost for member
→ Win-win
```

**Financial Impact:**
```
Specialty Rx Economics:

Current Specialty Volume: 5M Rx/year (1% of total)
Current MedImpact Direct Specialty capture: 30% = 1.5M Rx
Target with Clarity Price: 60% = 3M Rx

Margin per specialty Rx: $150 (dispensing fee + spreads)
Increase: 1.5M Rx x $150 = $225M/year additional revenue

Findr Health Partnership Cost: $20M/year
Net Benefit: $205M/year
ROI: 10x
```

---

### 3.3 Preferred Provider Network - The Strategic Weapon

**This is where Clarity AI becomes a REVENUE GENERATOR for MedImpact**

**Core Concept:**
MedImpact negotiates discounts with pharmacy chains. The more volume they send to a specific pharmacy, the better discounts they can negotiate.

**Current Problem:**
Members fill prescriptions wherever is convenient, not where MedImpact gets best pricing.

**Clarity AI Solution:**
Steer members to pharmacies where MedImpact has best contracts.

**Implementation:**

**Scenario: Member needs to fill prescription**

```
Member asks Clarity AI:
"Where should I fill my prescription?"

Clarity AI checks:
1. Member location (geolocation)
2. MedImpact preferred networks
3. Current pharmacy pricing

Clarity AI responds:
"💚 Best Value Options (save $20):
   
   Walmart Pharmacy
   📍 2.1 miles away
   💰 Your copay: $10
   ⭐ Rating: 4.5/5
   🕐 Ready in 30 minutes
   [Get Directions] [Transfer Rx]
   
   Costco Pharmacy
   📍 3.8 miles away
   💰 Your copay: $10
   ⭐ Rating: 4.7/5
   🕐 Ready in 1 hour
   [Get Directions] [Transfer Rx]

🟨 Nearby Options (standard pricing):
   
   CVS Pharmacy
   📍 0.5 miles away
   💰 Your copay: $30
   ⭐ Rating: 4.2/5
   
You'll save $20 at Walmart or Costco.
Want me to transfer your prescription?"

Member: "Yes, transfer to Walmart"
→ Clarity AI initiates transfer
→ Member drives to Walmart
→ Fills at preferred network
→ MedImpact saves $15-20 on reimbursement
→ Member saves $20 on copay
```

**The Hidden Revenue Play:**

MedImpact can now go to Walmart and say:

> "We're sending you 5 million additional prescriptions per year through our Clarity AI network steering. In exchange, we want an additional 5% discount on all prescriptions."

**Financial Impact:**
```
Network Steering Volume:
50M members x 12 Rx/year = 600M Rx/year
10% steered to preferred networks = 60M Rx/year

Increased Negotiating Leverage:
60M Rx x $50 average cost = $3B annual volume to negotiate with

Additional Discount Negotiated: 3-5%
$3B x 4% = $120M/year additional savings

Split with Plan Sponsors: 50% retained
MedImpact keeps: $60M/year

Findr Health Partnership Cost: $20M/year
Net Benefit: $40M/year
ROI: 2x on this use case alone
```

## PART 4: CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

As a behaviorist, I must address: **Will members actually use Clarity AI?**

### 4.1 Behavioral Psychology Principles

**Principle 1: Loss Aversion**
> People feel the pain of losing $20 twice as strongly as the pleasure of gaining $20.

**Application:**
When Clarity AI says "You'll save $20 at Walmart vs. CVS," members feel they're **losing** $20 by going to CVS. This drives behavior change.

**Evidence:**
- Kahneman & Tversky, Prospect Theory (1979)
- Loss aversion motivates 2x more than equivalent gain

---

**Principle 2: Choice Architecture (Nudging)**
> The way choices are presented dramatically affects decisions.

**Application:**
Clarity AI uses visual hierarchy:
- 💚 Green = Preferred (saves money)
- 🟨 Yellow = Standard (costs more)
- Clear dollar amounts ($10 vs $30)
- Distance displayed (convenience factor)

**Evidence:**
- Thaler & Sunstein, "Nudge" (2008)
- 40-60% behavior change with proper choice architecture

---

**Principle 3: Friction Reduction**
> Every additional step reduces completion rate by 20-30%.

**Application:**
Current member experience:
```
1. Get prescription
2. Call pharmacy
3. Give them Rx info
4. Wait on hold
5. Drive to pharmacy
6. Wait 20 minutes
7. Discover copay is $60
8. Decide whether to fill
Total: 8 steps, 60+ minutes
```

Clarity AI experience:
```
1. Ask "Where should I fill this?"
2. Click "Transfer to Walmart"
3. Drive to Walmart
4. Pick up (copay already known: $10)
Total: 4 steps, 20 minutes
```

**Result:** 50% faster, 50% fewer steps = Higher completion rate

---

**Principle 4: Social Proof**
> People follow others' behavior, especially in uncertain situations.

**Application:**
Clarity AI shows:
- "82% of members in your area use Walmart Pharmacy"
- "4.5/5 stars from 12,483 reviews"
- "Most popular choice for diabetes medications"

**Evidence:**
- Cialdini, "Influence" (1984)
- Social proof increases behavior adoption by 30-50%

---

### 4.2 Member Adoption Projections

**Baseline Assumptions:**
- 50M MedImpact members
- Average: 12 prescriptions/year per member
- 40% of Rx are maintenance medications (chronic conditions)

**Adoption Curve:**

**Year 1:**
- 10% of members try Clarity AI = 5M users
- 3% become regular users = 1.5M active users
- 1.5M x 12 Rx x 40% maintenance = 7.2M influenced Rx

**Year 2:**
- 25% of members try Clarity AI = 12.5M users
- 10% become regular users = 5M active users
- 5M x 12 Rx x 40% maintenance = 24M influenced Rx

**Year 3:**
- 40% of members try Clarity AI = 20M users
- 15% become regular users = 7.5M active users
- 7.5M x 12 Rx x 40% maintenance = 36M influenced Rx

**Steady State (Year 4+):**
- 50% of members try Clarity AI = 25M users
- 20% become regular users = 10M active users
- 10M x 12 Rx x 40% maintenance = 48M influenced Rx

## PART 7: RISK ANALYSIS

### 7.1 Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Data Integration Complexity**
- MedImpact has legacy systems
- Real-time formulary data may be challenging
- **Mitigation:** Phased integration, batch updates initially

**Risk 2: LLM Accuracy**
- Clarity AI provides wrong information
- Member makes bad decision based on AI
- **Mitigation:** Human review layer, liability insurance, clear disclaimers

**Risk 3: Member Adoption**
- Members don't trust AI
- Low engagement despite marketing
- **Mitigation:** Pilot program validation, A/B testing, incentives

---

### 7.2 Business Risks

**Risk 1: Regulatory Scrutiny**
- FTC views AI-powered steering as anti-competitive
- State regulators require disclosure
- **Mitigation:** Transparency reports, member choice emphasis

- Threaten to leave MedImpact network
- **Mitigation:** Maintain standard network, steering is member choice

**Risk 3: Plan Sponsor Concerns**
- Employers worried about data privacy
- Union plans want control over member communications
- **Mitigation:** Opt-out capability, data privacy audits

---

### 7.3 Competitive Risks

**Risk 1: Big 3 Copy the Model**

- Better resources and scale
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market (6-12 month lead), patent AI methodology

**Risk 2: Amazon Pharmacy Entry**
- Amazon builds superior AI experience
- Undercuts pricing
- **Mitigation:** Focus on PBM relationships, not just price

**Risk 3: GoodRx/Singlecare Competition**
