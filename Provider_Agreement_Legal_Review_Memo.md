# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Tim / Findr Health  
**FROM:** Senior Legal Review  
**DATE:** January 1, 2026  
**RE:** Critical Review of Provider Participation Agreement — Recommended Revisions

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I have reviewed the draft Provider Participation Agreement. While the document establishes a solid foundation for the Provider relationship, including appropriate independent contractor language and liability protections, **I have identified 24 issues** that should be addressed before deployment.

**Overall Assessment:** B  
The document is stronger than the initial Patient TOS draft, but contains gaps—particularly in the arbitration provisions—that could create inconsistencies and enforceability concerns.

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. Missing Class Action Waiver — INCONSISTENCY WITH PATIENT TOS

**Problem:** The Patient TOS (Section 14.7) contains a robust class action waiver, but the Provider Agreement has NO class action waiver. This creates:
- Inconsistent treatment across platform participants
- Exposure to class action litigation from Providers
- Potential for mass arbitration without procedural safeguards

**Recommended Addition (new Section 15.5):**
> "**15.5 Class Action Waiver.** THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver in this Section 15.5 is unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from arbitration and may proceed in court, while all other claims shall remain subject to arbitration."

---

### 2. Missing Injunctive Relief Carve-Out — GAP

**Problem:** No exception allowing Findr Health to seek emergency injunctive relief in court for IP violations, confidentiality breaches, or Platform security threats. This is standard in marketplace agreements.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 15.4A):**
> "**15.4A Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or data security, without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above."

---

### 3. Exclusion Rights Need Strengthening — YOUR SPECIFIC REQUEST

**Current Provisions:** Article 14.3 allows termination for breach, license issues, insurance loss, fraud, and harmful conduct. Article 14.4 allows suspension pending investigation.

**Problem:** While functional, the current language could be strengthened to:
- Make clear Findr Health has absolute discretion
- Specify additional grounds for exclusion
- Clarify that no appeals process is required
- Protect against wrongful termination claims

**Recommended Revision to Section 14.3:**
> "**14.3 Termination and Exclusion by Findr Health.** Findr Health may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement and permanently exclude Provider from the Platform: (a) upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice for any reason or no reason; (b) immediately upon notice if Provider breaches any term of this Agreement, whether material or not; (c) immediately if Provider's license is suspended, revoked, restricted, or subject to disciplinary action; (d) immediately if Provider fails to maintain required insurance coverage; (e) immediately if Provider engages in fraud, dishonesty, misrepresentation, or illegal activity; (f) immediately if Provider engages in conduct that harms, threatens, or endangers Patients or the Platform; (g) immediately if Provider receives multiple substantiated complaints from Patients; (h) immediately if Provider fails to maintain minimum quality standards as determined by Findr Health; (i) immediately if Provider violates any applicable healthcare law or professional standard; (j) immediately if Provider's conduct, in Findr Health's sole judgment, reflects poorly on the Platform or Findr Health's reputation; or (k) immediately for any other reason Findr Health deems appropriate in its sole discretion. FINDR HEALTH'S DECISION TO TERMINATE OR EXCLUDE A PROVIDER IS FINAL AND NOT SUBJECT TO APPEAL. Provider waives any claims for wrongful termination or exclusion from the Platform."

**Recommended Addition (new Section 14.3A):**
> "**14.3A Exclusion List.** Findr Health may maintain a list of excluded Providers who are prohibited from rejoining the Platform. Providers who are terminated for cause under Section 14.3(b)-(k) may be permanently excluded from future participation. Any attempt by an excluded Provider to rejoin the Platform under a different identity or business name constitutes fraud and may result in legal action."

---

### 4. No Statute of Limitations — GAP

**Problem:** Without a contractual limitations period, Providers have the full statutory period to bring claims. This is inconsistent with the Patient TOS (which now has a 1-year limitation).

**Recommended Addition (new Section 17.12):**
> "**17.12 Limitation on Claims.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PLATFORM MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE, OR BE FOREVER BARRED. This limitation applies regardless of whether the claim or cause of action is based on contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory."

---

### 5. Missing Fee/Cost Allocation in Arbitration — GAP

**Problem:** The agreement doesn't specify who pays arbitration filing fees and costs. Under AAA Commercial Rules (different from Consumer Rules), fees can be substantial.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 15.3A):**
> "**15.3A Arbitration Fees and Costs.** Each Party shall pay its own filing fees, unless the arbitrator determines that such fees would be prohibitively expensive for one Party, in which case the arbitrator may apportion fees. The Parties shall share equally the arbitrator's fees and any AAA administrative fees. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees unless the arbitrator awards fees to the prevailing party as permitted under Section 15.8."

---

### 6. Background Check / Verification Rights Missing — RISK MITIGATION

**Problem:** While Article 6.3 mentions verification rights, there's no provision for background checks, which may be appropriate for healthcare Providers on the Platform.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 6.6):**
> "**6.6 Background Checks.** Provider authorizes Findr Health to conduct, or engage third parties to conduct, background checks on Provider and Provider's staff, including criminal history checks, licensure verification, sanctions screening (OIG, SAM, state exclusion lists), and malpractice history. Provider agrees to provide all information and authorizations necessary to complete such checks. Findr Health may, in its sole discretion, deny or terminate Platform access based on the results of any background check. Provider acknowledges that Findr Health's decision to conduct or not conduct background checks does not create any duty to Patients or liability for Provider conduct."

---

### 7. Non-Solicitation / Non-Circumvention Weak — REVENUE PROTECTION

**Problem:** Section 9.6(c) briefly mentions not circumventing Platform fees, but this should be stronger to protect Platform revenue.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.7):**
> "**9.7 Non-Circumvention.** Provider agrees not to: (a) solicit, encourage, or facilitate any Patient to book services outside the Platform to avoid Platform fees; (b) provide Patients with contact information or booking links that bypass the Platform; (c) offer discounts or incentives to Patients who book outside the Platform; or (d) otherwise circumvent the Platform's booking or payment systems. Violation of this Section 9.7 shall result in immediate termination and Provider shall pay Findr Health liquidated damages equal to the Platform fees that would have been earned on the circumvented transactions, plus any investigation costs incurred by Findr Health."

---

### 8. Audit Rights Missing — COMPLIANCE

**Problem:** No provision allowing Findr Health to audit Provider records for compliance with the Agreement.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.8):**
> "**9.8 Audit Rights.** Upon reasonable notice, Findr Health may audit Provider's records related to Platform activities to verify compliance with this Agreement, including but not limited to verification of credentials, insurance, pricing accuracy, and booking records. Provider shall cooperate fully with any such audit and provide access to relevant records within ten (10) business days of request. Failure to cooperate with an audit constitutes a material breach of this Agreement."

---

## SIGNIFICANT ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 9. No Representations and Warranties Section

**Problem:** Provider representations and warranties are scattered throughout the document. A consolidated section improves clarity and enforceability.

**Recommended Addition (new Article 6A after Article 6):**
> "**ARTICLE 6A: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**
>
> **6A.1 Provider Representations.** Provider represents and warrants that: (a) Provider has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement; (b) Provider's execution of this Agreement does not violate any other agreement to which Provider is a party; (c) all information provided to Findr Health is true, accurate, and complete; (d) Provider holds all licenses and credentials required to provide the Services; (e) Provider maintains all required insurance coverage; (f) Provider is not currently excluded from any federal or state healthcare program; (g) Provider has no pending malpractice claims or disciplinary actions not disclosed to Findr Health; (h) Provider will comply with all applicable laws in performing Services; and (i) Provider has not been convicted of any felony or crime involving dishonesty.
>
> **6A.2 Ongoing Obligation.** Provider agrees to notify Findr Health within five (5) business days if any representation or warranty in Section 6A.1 becomes untrue or inaccurate."

---

### 10. No Notification of Material Changes — GAP

**Problem:** Article 6.2 requires notification of license status changes, but should be broader to cover all material changes.

**Recommended Revision to Section 6.2 (add at end):**
> "Provider shall also immediately notify Findr Health of: (a) any malpractice claim or lawsuit filed against Provider; (b) any disciplinary action or investigation by any licensing board or professional organization; (c) any exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs; (d) any criminal charges or indictments; (e) any change in ownership, control, or legal structure of Provider's practice; (f) any change in Provider's physical location; or (g) any other event that could materially affect Provider's ability to perform Services or Provider's reputation."

---

### 11. Service Level Expectations Missing — QUALITY CONTROL

**Problem:** No minimum standards for Provider responsiveness, booking acceptance rates, or service quality.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.9):**
> "**9.9 Service Level Expectations.** Provider agrees to: (a) respond to booking requests within 24 hours; (b) maintain a booking acceptance rate of at least 80%; (c) maintain a cancellation rate of less than 10%; (d) maintain a minimum Patient rating of 3.5 stars (or equivalent); and (e) respond to Patient messages within 48 hours. Failure to meet these standards may result in reduced visibility on the Platform, suspension, or termination. Findr Health may modify these standards upon thirty (30) days' notice."

---

### 12. Force Majeure Missing — STANDARD PROVISION

**Problem:** Unlike the Patient TOS, the Provider Agreement has no force majeure clause.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 17.13):**
> "**17.13 Force Majeure.** Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, epidemics, pandemics, public health emergencies, infrastructure failures, or healthcare system disruptions. The affected Party shall provide prompt notice and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact."

---

### 13. No Feedback License — IP PROTECTION

**Problem:** If Providers suggest improvements to the Platform, Findr Health should have clear rights to use that feedback.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 11.6):**
> "**11.6 Feedback.** If Provider provides any feedback, suggestions, ideas, or recommendations regarding the Platform ("Feedback"), Provider grants Findr Health a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, modify, and incorporate such Feedback into the Platform or any products or services, without any obligation or compensation to Provider."

---

### 14. Geographic Scope Missing — CLARITY

**Problem:** No specification of geographic scope of Platform operations.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 3.7):**
> "**3.7 Geographic Scope.** The Platform currently operates in the United States only. Provider may only list Services that will be performed at locations within the United States. Provider may not use the Platform to offer Services in jurisdictions where Provider is not licensed to practice."

---

### 15. Data Portability / Transition Assistance Missing — FAIRNESS

**Problem:** No provision addressing what happens to Provider data and Patient relationships upon termination.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 14.7):**
> "**14.7 Transition and Data.** Upon termination, Provider may request an export of Provider's own data (excluding Findr Health proprietary information and Patient PHI) within thirty (30) days. Findr Health has no obligation to provide Patient contact information or facilitate ongoing relationships with Patients met through the Platform. Provider acknowledges that Patient relationships established through the Platform remain subject to Findr Health's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service."

---

### 16. No Insurance Claims Cooperation Clause — RISK MANAGEMENT

**Problem:** If Findr Health is named in a lawsuit arising from Provider services, there's no requirement for Provider to cooperate with Findr Health's insurance carrier.

**Recommended Addition to Article 12 (new Section 12.4):**
> "**12.4 Insurance Cooperation.** In the event of any claim or lawsuit arising from Provider's Services, Provider agrees to cooperate fully with Findr Health and its insurance carriers, including providing documents, attending depositions, and testifying at trial if necessary. This cooperation obligation survives termination of this Agreement."

---

## MODERATE ISSUES (Consider Fixing)

### 17. Time Zone Not Specified for Notices

**Problem:** 30-day notice periods don't specify time zone or when notice is deemed received.

**Recommended Revision to Section 17.7:**
> "**17.7 Notices.** Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent to the email address associated with Provider's account or, for notices to Findr Health, to the address specified on the Platform. Notices shall be deemed delivered: (a) if by email, when sent, provided no bounce-back or delivery failure notice is received within 24 hours; (b) if by certified mail, three (3) business days after mailing. All time periods in this Agreement are calculated based on Mountain Time (MT)."

---

### 18. Inconsistent Use of "Material Breach" 

**Problem:** Some sections specify "material breach" while others just say "breach." This could create interpretation issues.

**Recommendation:** Review document and either: (a) consistently use "material breach" for provisions that should trigger termination; or (b) add a definition of material breach; or (c) remove "material" qualifier from Section 14.3(b) to make clear ANY breach can trigger termination.

**Current Section 14.3(b):** "immediately upon notice if Provider breaches any material term of this Agreement"

**Recommended Change:** "immediately upon notice if Provider breaches any term of this Agreement"

---

### 19. No Anti-Bribery / Anti-Corruption Clause

**Problem:** Healthcare providers may be subject to anti-kickback statutes. A general anti-corruption clause adds protection.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.10):**
> "**9.10 Anti-Corruption.** Provider represents that Provider has not and will not offer, pay, promise, or authorize any bribe, kickback, or other improper payment in connection with this Agreement or Services. Provider shall comply with all applicable anti-kickback, anti-bribery, and anti-corruption laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b)."

---

### 20. No Successor and Assigns Clarity for Provider Sales

**Problem:** Section 17.6 addresses assignment but doesn't clearly address what happens if Provider sells their practice.

**Recommended Revision to Section 17.6:**
> "**17.6 Assignment.** Provider may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights hereunder without Findr Health's prior written consent, including in connection with a sale, merger, or transfer of Provider's practice. Any purported assignment without consent is void. Findr Health may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns."

---

### 21. No Conflict of Interest Disclosure

**Problem:** No requirement for Provider to disclose conflicts of interest.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.11):**
> "**9.11 Conflicts of Interest.** Provider shall disclose to Findr Health any financial interest in products or services recommended to Patients, any ownership interest in competing platforms, or any other actual or potential conflict of interest that could affect Provider's obligations under this Agreement."

---

### 22. Missing Electronic Signature Acknowledgment

**Problem:** The acceptance section references E-SIGN Act but could be stronger.

**Recommended Enhancement to Acceptance Section:**
> Add: "Provider agrees that electronic records and signatures have the same legal effect as written records and manual signatures, and waives any right to claim that this Agreement is unenforceable due to its electronic format."

---

### 23. No Quality Improvement / Training Cooperation

**Problem:** No provision for Provider cooperation with quality improvement initiatives.

**Recommended Addition (new Section 9.12):**
> "**9.12 Quality Improvement.** Provider agrees to participate in reasonable quality improvement initiatives, training programs, and compliance education offered or required by Findr Health. Such participation may include completing online training modules, attending webinars, and implementing updated policies or procedures communicated by Findr Health."

---

### 24. Survival Clause Should Include Article 6A (Representations)

**Problem:** If Article 6A (Representations and Warranties) is added, it should be included in the survival clause.

**Recommended Revision to Section 14.6:**
> "**14.6 Survival.** The following provisions shall survive termination: Article 2 (Independent Contractor), Article 6A (Representations and Warranties), Article 11 (Intellectual Property), Article 12 (Indemnification), Article 13 (Limitation of Liability), Article 15 (Dispute Resolution), Article 16 (Confidentiality), and Article 17 (General Provisions)."

---

## CONCLUSION

The Provider Participation Agreement is a solid foundation but requires strengthening in several key areas, particularly:

1. **Arbitration provisions** need to match the Patient TOS (class action waiver, injunctive relief)
2. **Exclusion rights** need to be more comprehensive and absolute
3. **Risk mitigation provisions** (background checks, audit rights, non-circumvention) are missing
4. **Quality control provisions** (service levels, training) would benefit the Platform

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement all CRITICAL revisions
2. Implement SIGNIFICANT revisions
3. Have Montana counsel review, especially healthcare-specific provisions
4. Ensure Provider Agreement and Patient TOS are aligned

I am available to discuss these recommendations and assist with revisions.
